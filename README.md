# NYC Bikesharing Analysis:

## Overview of the Statistical Analysis:

### Purpose:
For this analysis, we used Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, created a set of visualizations to:
  * Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
  * Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
  * Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
Finally, we added these two new visualizations to the our final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.

## Results:

### Deliverable 1:
For this deliverable, we wrote a program to convert the trip duration column to datetime after checking the datatypes of the dataframe. 

Here are the screenshots from the code showing before and after converting the data in the csv file:

### Deliverable 3:
  In this section we are adding our summary and two additional visualizations for future analyses:
  
  First of all our story: We created multiple Captions or Story points. Here are all seperate images:

  ## Summary:
New York, being a major mega city, is a popular tourist destination and it is considered one of the busiest cities in the world. People who live there as well as the visitors prefer convienient, affordable, and environmentally friendly ways to get around in a busy city center. Technology has made it easy to establish these kinds of businesses for more conceivable to manage, maintain, and consistently net profits. Here we prepared this analysis for New York City but it is largely adoptable for any city in the country or the world.

It is clear that males use bikes significantly more and take the subscription more. We can start a scheme to provide family passes with bundle discounts to attract more women and kids to use these bikes.

I also suggest to have different rates for rush-hours and non rush-hours as we can clearly see a hike in rush hour usage. 
We created a story in Tableau to prepare our final presentation.
