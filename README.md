## Overview of the Statistical Analysis:
### Purpose:
For this analysis, we used Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, created a set of visualizations to:
  * Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
  * Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
  * Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
Finally, we added these two new visualizations to the our final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.

  It is clear that males uses the bikes significantly more and takes the subscription more. We can start a scheme to provide family passes with bundle discounts to attact more women and kids to use these bikes.
  Also we suggest to have different rates for Rush-hours and non Rush_hours as we can clearly see a hike in rush hour usage.
